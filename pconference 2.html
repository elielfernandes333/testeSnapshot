                        <h2>Pre-Conference Workshop</h2>
                        <p>As in previous years, ISCHE 45 offers the possibility of organizing a pre-conference workshop
                            (PCW). Such workshops are small focused meetings that will take place on Sunday, 18 August
                            2024, immediately before the main ISCHE conference will start, and are considered integral
                            parts of the conference.</p>
                        </br>
                        <p>PCWs are intended to provoke intellectual discussion, among a diverse range of participants,
                            on a specific topic that does not relate to the conference theme. PCWs may also consist of
                            workshops discussing critical issues, methods, theories emerging in the field. </p>
                        </br>
                        <p>PCWs may include some invited speakers and presenters, but must also include a public call
                            for presentations. PCW organizers and presenters are expected to register and participate in
                            the accompanying ISCHE conference. The overall number of attendees may be limited. ISCHE
                            offers no financial support for such workshops, but conference registrants will be able to
                            pre-register for PCWs at no additional fee.</p>
                        </br>
                        <p>Proposers should initially contact the Secretary of ISCHE, <a
                                href="mailto:angelo.vangorp@rptu.de">Angelo Van Gorp</a>, for advice about preparing an
                            application. After consultation, the conveners for a PCW should submit a proposal by 29
                            February containing the following information:</p>
                        </br>
                        <p>The names and contact details of the PCW conveners;
                            A one-page argument stating the intellectual objectives of the pre-conference workshop
                            (including how it is related to ISCHE goals);
                            Evidence that the PCW’s objectives does not overlap with existing Standing Working Groups;
                        </p>
                        <p>A list of potential contributors to such a workshop that demonstrates geographical diversity
                            Indication of the length of the event (e.g., full day, half day, two hours)
                            The ISCHE EC will decide on the acceptance of proposals. Once finalized, the program of the
                            PCW is posted on the ISCHE conference website.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> Date and timeframe: Sunday 19 August 2024 / 14:00–17:00</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The workshop is aimed at researchers interested in discussing issues related to scientific denialism from the interface between History of Education and History of the Curriculum. Early Career Researchers (ECRs) will be welcome. The audience limit is 30 participants, excluding speakers. Depending on the registered audience, the workshop may be held in English, Spanish or Portuguese. But the preference will be for the Portuguese language. </p>


                        <p>We have witnessed the emergence of political groups aiming to manipulate public opinion and rewrite history by denying scientific evidence and revising well-established historical facts. In this process, they seek to influence public policy formulation, promoting the relativization of crimes against humanity, spreading hate speech, casting doubt on scientific and technological advancements, or legitimizing oppressive practices against political minorities. This workshop aligns with the central theme of ISCHE 45 and responds to this pressing issue. This workshop aims to provide theoretical and methodological support for conducting research using educational narratives that contribute to socio-historical analyses of curricula, with a focus on decolonial perspectives, and to encourage the development of pluralistic, diverse, and democratic Histories of Education. The workshop justification is due to the understanding that school curricula are political, social, and historical constructs, subject to ongoing clashes and disputes regarding their content and pedagogical approaches across different historical periods. Amidst denialism and revisionism, critically examining curricular productions and interrogating the underlying issues at various social levels, beginning with the classroom, is imperative. The primary target audience for this workshop includes aspiring educational historians interested in the historiography of school curricula, particularly in contemporary times. The workshop will last three hours, and it aims to introduce fundamental concepts related to narrative research and discuss the foundational dimensions of works that aim to contextualize and historicize curricula through the voices of educational subjects. These narratives provide insight into the lived experiences inscribed in their educational journeys. By exploring this theoretical and methodological framework, we aim to contextualize and stimulate research on curricular issues that challenge the field of Education History, thereby contributing to the fight against scientific denialism and historical revisionism. Additionally, we will present concrete examples of narrative research employing a curricular perspective, fostering collective discussion and reflection among participants.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Beginners, but please do feel free to email us if you need help.
                            We would be happy to provide
                            links to tutorials if needed. If there are more than twelve submissions, we will start a
                            selection
                            process based on how convincingly the central issues of the workshop have been taken into
                            consideration. Those who register for the workshop agree that copies of their videos will be
                            uploaded to the ISCHE Education & Pandemics Archive for public use.</p>
